gaussian process with costan additive kernel w/ 0.5 plateau


L4CasADi enables the use of PyTorch models and functions in a CasADi graph while supporting CasADi code generation capabilities. The only requirement on the PyTorch model is to be traceable and differentiable

gpytorch works with 2.14, but gpu is allowed with 2.12

To enable the following instructions: AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.

Note: this notebook is not necessarily intended to teach the mathematical background of Gaussian processes, but rather how to train a simple one and make predictions in GPyTorch. For a mathematical treatment, Chapter 2 of Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning provides a very thorough introduction to GP regression (this entire text is highly recommended): http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf
